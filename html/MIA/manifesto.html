                    <div class="c-content">
                        <p>Since planning to join Boskalis as a Fleet Management Trainee, the idea of being hands on working on a project, on a multi disciplanry role was one of the ideas that resonated on my mind. Indeed, as I have discussed with my internal coach Gaby Steentjes, on some positions, a generalist can be someone that provides a drone view to a project. In my opinion, I think this is one of the positions where a multiskilled colleague can become a key partner on the following six months for the project.</p>
<p><strong>ROLE DESCRIPTORS AND ADDED VALUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Openness to develop different tasks <br /></strong>Since I decided I wanted to work for Boskalis, I understood that my Nautical background might not be the most handy on a company that does not perform pure shipping and fleet management, but complex engineering projects. Therefore, I understood that I could make from my handicap</p>
<p><strong>Hands on and practical traineeship<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Interest on operational aspects<br /></strong>Indeed, and as I expressed previously to my colleagues, on this first assignment I missed a bit of experience on operational matters. I see this assignment, as a good opportunity to get this real field experience and grow from the Fleet Management perspective to a more operational profile, that could lead me to better understand Boskalis.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>I think this opportunity fits well on my portfolio of activities within Boskalis. Although housing in Saudi Arabia is still a challenge and may make of this opportunity a Papendrecht based position, I also see this as a chance to use the network I developed in OE FM on a Papendrecht based role. Also, because during the end of my last assignment, I was for 1 month assisting TSIs, and I truly believe that it is a position that suits my motivations and skills.</p>

Do you make enough time to reflect on your own development? To think about your dreams and ambitions? The world is changing faster than ever, and according to tech entrepreneur and futurologist Peter Hinssen, rather than thinking about what you are doing today or even tomorrow, you need to focus on “the day after tomorrow”.
During this Human Excellence hybrid event, Peter Hinssen will take you through his vision on the rapidly changing world and the additional opportunities and challenges it brings. He will hold up a mirror to you in an inspiring and humorous way and make you reflect on why there is no other choice but to focus on your own development.
About Peter HinssenPeter Hinssen is an entrepreneur, consultant and sought-after keynote speaker on radical innovation and leadership. He has given countless presentations around the world, at companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Accenture and more. He has also written several books on these topics.
Practical informationDate: 22 NovemberStart: 10:00 AM (CET)End: 11:30 AM

                As part of the Making the difference together vision of the Dredging &amp; Inland Infra division a series of tributes to colleagues and teams is being developed to tell the stories on how they all make a difference together.
This second tribute is dedicated to the teams within Fleet Management Dredging. Following the review of the internal auditing process for the office, the Nautical Department came up with an interesting new approach: direct colleagues auditing each other, rather than having the Offshore Energy division or outside parties conduct the audit. Watch the video and learn from the colleagues involved and see how they turned cold feet and initial skepticism into a positive experience.
Open and honestAfter one day of training, an internal audit team was well equipped to audit the colleagues within their own department/team. The new approach led to new ways of asking critical questions and being more open and honest towards each other in a constructive manner. Moreover, this was a great way to connect colleagues and to come up with new solutions together.
More informationThe first tribute was dedicated to the team involved in the startup of the Magnor on the Fehmarnbelt project. You can find more information about the vision Making the difference together of the Dredging &amp; Inland Infra division here.
